How to give people power:

  - voting on game content, mechanics
  - priority in some things that involve a rush
  - specific game events
  - being able to enter areas that are only open to certain levels
  - early access to beta stuff
  - ability to exclude people / members only areas
  - ability to own land
  - running bots
  - action throttling
  - vote on commits (kinda abstract, possibly game-breaking)
    - maybe limit it to location-specific stuff only
    - would still have to pass tests
    - many changes would be related to special casing groups or individuals,
      one might expect


Scarcity:

  - file-sharing (but probably difficult)
  - space / logical distance
    - for example, in a code bazaar situation, projects would want to get
      near the larger projects so they get more "walk-in" traffic
  - story specific medallions
  - access to new areas
  - time-played, perhaps give small tokens for every hour the person is
    logged in to the game, some amount of verification probs necessary
    - rewards uptime
  - accounts and invites, possibly what.cd-esque


Political systems:

  - liquid democracy: allow people to organically proxy their votes on certain
    subjects to others whom they think are experts

  - demarchy: frequent real-time (or slightly slower) votes on topics,
    everybody participates in the political structure

    - coders can write agents for themselves to automatically vote certain ways
      on certain issues

  - some example issues:

    - allow new locations to join the world
    - allow new players to join the world
    - allow the creation of new corporations / projects
    - ban people


Chat and channels:

  - piggyback on irc, hopefully
  - alternatively build similar communication network


Bots and Spimes:

  - backendable to an http interface
  - probably limited in number based on some power rating


Ownership and Transfer:

  - objects are given to others by signing them over, ownership chain is
    visible, though possibly truncate-able


Code bazaar land rush:

  - create an area of the game associated with github (possibly others)
    projects
  - assign projects some power based on number of watchers/forks,
  - projects owners are verifiable via github
  - area assignable for a project based on size, smaller projects can claim
    that space
    - possibly smaller projects can share their space with other projects to
      gain larger / better areas
    - possibly have better control over the layout and structure of their
      spaces and the projects within their fold


For design purposes:

  - create a tool to visualize location layout
