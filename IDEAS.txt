How to give people power:

  - voting on game content, mechanics
  - priority in some things that involve a rush
  - specific game events
  - being able to enter areas that are only open to certain levels
  - early access to beta stuff
  - ability to exclude people / members only areas
  - ability to own land
  - running bots
  - action throttling
  - vote on commits (kinda abstract, possibly game-breaking)
    - maybe limit it to location-specific stuff only
    - would still have to pass tests
    - many changes would be related to special casing groups or individuals,
      one might expect


Scarcity:

  - file-sharing (but probably difficult)
  - space / logical distance
    - for example, in a code bazaar situation, projects would want to get
      near the larger projects so they get more "walk-in" traffic
  - story specific medallions
  - access to new areas
  - time-played, perhaps give small tokens for every hour the person is
    logged in to the game, some amount of verification probs necessary
    - rewards uptime
  - accounts and invites, possibly what.cd-esque


Political systems:

  - liquid democracy: allow people to organically proxy their votes on certain
    subjects to others whom they think are experts

  - demarchy: frequent real-time (or slightly slower) votes on topics,
    everybody participates in the political structure

    - coders can write agents for themselves to automatically vote certain ways
      on certain issues

  - some example issues:

    - allow new locations to join the world
    - allow new players to join the world
    - allow the creation of new corporations / projects
    - ban people


Chat and channels:

  - piggyback on irc, hopefully
  - alternatively build similar communication network


Bots and Spimes:

  - backendable to an http interface
  - probably limited in number based on some power rating


Ownership and Transfer:

  - objects are given to others by signing them over, ownership chain is
    visible, though possibly truncate-able


Code bazaar land rush:

  - create an area of the game associated with github (possibly others)
    projects
  - assign projects some power based on number of watchers/forks,
  - projects owners are verifiable via github
  - area assignable for a project based on size, smaller projects can claim
    that space
    - possibly smaller projects can share their space with other projects to
      gain larger / better areas
    - possibly have better control over the layout and structure of their
      spaces and the projects within their fold


For design purposes:

  - create a tool to visualize location layout


Layers / Multiple Reality:
  - Keys are shared and trusted, people start off trusting the world
    key
  - Signed content vs encrypted content, signed content public but
    not necessarily trusted, encrypted content requires sharing a
    key, by default both are ignored when unknown
  - Initial awakening from tutorial fantasy world that is revealed to
    be a simulation that teaches you to add the fingerprint for the
    "real" world to start accepting that content

Presence / Map Enforcement:
  - World needs a way to prevent people being in two locations at
    once, clients and nodes must subscribe to a global presence
    service, nodes do not allow entry without multi-party handshake
    - Does the map know the map or do the nodes know the map?
      - Nodes know the map:
        - must agree to share a portal with each other
        - must be aware of allowed incoming nodes
        - outgoing room signs a move request from the client,
          presence server signs the move request,
          client hands request to new room,
          new room signs it and hands it to presence server,
          presence server updates presence
      - Presence server knows the map:
        - nodes must trust the presence server
        - nodes don't need to know about each other
        - outgoing room signs a move request from the client,
          presence server signs the move request,
          client is removed from the room,
          client hands the move request to new room,
          incoming room accepts request (already verified by world)
        - makes teleporting easier, probably


Chat Channels:
  - Chat services are advertised, you can connect your client to them
  - Some are anonymous, gevulot style, your fingerprint is your id,
    if you've got a handle for somebody you can use that as a reference
  - Is it possible to just use IRC? Don't know whether we actually want
    to be a chat protocol
    - without some group chat with this anon stuff it'd be hard to
      organize anything
    - maybe can leverage some existing tech and wrap it in crypto
  - re crypto it seems like there isn't a good forward secrecy group
    chat protocol, seems like most solutions don't scale to large
    groups
    - may be able to do something like have a single host who acts
      as the hub and exchanges symm keys with a limited number of
      people, your trust then relies on trusting the hub individual

General comm protocol:
  - Ask server to connect you to other, signed
  - other decides whether to accept your request
  - ECDH exchange or whatever with other
  - sign your request and send it over
  - other decides whether to respond
  - talk all encryptedstyle
  Notes:
    - server knows who you are trying to communicate with and
      whether they responded
    - server doesn't know what you asked, though does know the size
      of the result
    - could maybe assign a third party arbiter and use out-of-band
      identifiers to route a la Tor


Scifi Concepts:
  - The Oubliette and Gevulot (quantum thief)
    - Privacy fog: allow settings on what is seen and shared, people
                   only have names if they share one, up to you to
                   associate them, people can change their IDs and
                   fingerprints to lose their identity
    - Changing cityscape: allow portals to move about on an scheduled
                          basis, maybe something like wormhole space,
                          would be cool if there were some weights that
                          helped them re-associate with thematically
                          good places
